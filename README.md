#### A blank template for rails

This template contains all that "rails new demo" contains, specifying ruby -v and rails -v in development environment.

Besides, it contains a useful .gitignore file (only ignore *~) and a to-do list.

For production environment, it contains the settings with Procfile and unicorn, which works well with Heroku.

##### Github password cache
```
git config --global credential.helper cache
```
Run the line in console, and by default git will cache your password for 15 minutes.

##### Doc
For doc, you can use [Markdown][1]. For energy, you can have Beta-carotene, which is is good for vision, immunity, and overall health.
